ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm George Mbaria Muchina, a data analyst from Nairobi, Kenya. I'm interested in using data to solve real-world problems and create meaningful insights.

ðŸ’» I'm proficient in Python, R, Pandas, Git, GitLab, SQL, and Macros, and I have experience working with CSS, TDD, and MFML.

ðŸ”¬ Some of my recent projects include exploring San Francisco Bay Area's bike share data to determine the average trip duration and identify the shortest routes with the cheapest prices for promotions.

ðŸ’¼ I'm currently working as a data analyst at Kenya Industrial Estate, where I use Pandas to identify market share for small SMEs in Kenya and analyze data to gain insights. Previously, I worked at Somak Travel as a data analyst, where I matched travel accommodations for groups, couples, and executive clients and presented data visualizations in annual meetings.

ðŸ“š I hold a Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity.
